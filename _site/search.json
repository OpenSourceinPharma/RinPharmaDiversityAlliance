We both decided to go to the panel on open-source adoption in pharma. We were astonished when the panel came on stage and of the 11 people up there only 1 person wasn’t white and only 1 person wasn’t a man!\nWe may never know whether it was fate or just our general aura of feminist rage that brought us together, but we struck up a conversation that lasted several hours. We wondered how we could ensure that the complex and impactful topic of the adoption of open-source is shaped by diverse voices with better diversity of ideas and approaches. That’s when we realised, we were probably just as qualified as anyone else to do this.\nAdditionally we reflected on conferences and communities that are inclusive which led us to R/Pharma and Harvey Lieberman. We chatted to Harvey to share our ideas and we decided to create PROUD!\n\n\n\nWhat is the Diversity Alliance?\nThe Diversity Alliance is an inclusive R community for developers who work in the pharma space. Trying to address the structural inequality that affects our community. We want all ways of being and doing to feel welcome.\n\n\nWhat are Diversity Alliance’s objectives?\nThe goals of PROUD are to provide a welcoming, equitable and supportive space for people to upskill, share knowledge and build a community of diverse voices.\nUpskilling: Let’s work together to identify topics that we can workshop and grow our skills. For e.g. use of git, best practice in R package development, etc.\nCommunity: Build an inclusive community that offers opportunities for collaboration. Brainstorm how we can leverage this community as a resource for nominations for representation at conferences, working groups, etc.\n\n\n\nHow can I get involved?\nThere are several ways to get involved with the Diversity Alliance:\n\nParticipating in our monthly meetups:\n\n\nlearn new skills as we workshop open-source topics\nhelp co-define the agenda and topics for future meetups\nmake new connections\n\n\nCo-host a workshop:\n\n\nis there a topic you are enthusiastic about that you’d like to share with the community\ndid you have a steep learning curve that you want to soften for others - let’s share our tips and tricks.\n\n\nAre you organising sessions and you want to tap into a diverse group of people:\n\n\nthe PROUD chairs would like to brainstorm how we can be more proactive about ensuring under-recognised people are better included.\nslack?\nmonthly meet ups / webinars"
