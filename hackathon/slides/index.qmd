## Diversity Alliance {.smaller}

# Goals and Aspirations
Our goal is to provide a welcoming, equitable and supportive space for people to upskill, share knowledge and build a community of diverse voices. We want all ways of being and doing to feel welcome.

We launched in March 2024 and we've ran [monthly meetings](../../events.qmd) to begin to grow our community.
