## Diversity Alliance {.smaller}

We aspire to be an inclusive R community for developers who work in the pharma space. The Alliance is chaired by Christina Fillmore, Harvey Lieberman and Orla Doyle.  

If you want to know more check out our [origin story](../../about.qmd).

## Goals and Aspirations
Our goal is to provide a welcoming, equitable and supportive space for people to upskill, share knowledge and build a community of diverse voices. We want all ways of being and doing to feel welcome.  
We hope to have a positive impact through:  
1. Opportunities for upskilling  
2. Opportunities for networking / community building  
3. Promote speaking / panel opportunities to a diverse network

We launched in March 2024. We run [monthly meetings](../../events.qmd) to begin to grow our community.
