title: "R/Pharma Hackathon 2024"
---

Do you identify as underrepresented and would you like to get involved in open source projects? Then please keep readingâ€¦ this hackathon may be for you! 

During our early Diversity Alliance meetings we discussed how we might be able to minimise barriers to entry in the open-source community (from opening issues to making your first pull request). We found that a common denominator in our Alliance members: someone helped me get started. 

We would like to use this hackathon to help you get started. Join mentors from the R/Pharma community to learn about how to contribute to open source projects. You'll work with mentors in small groups, tackling open issues in real projects.

At the end of this hackathon we hope you will have expanded your network in our community and having gained increased familiarity with making contributions in the open-source space.
