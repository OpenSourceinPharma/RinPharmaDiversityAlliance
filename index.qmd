We aspire to be an inclusive R community for developers who work in the pharma space. Our goal is to provide a welcoming, equitable and supportive space for people to upskill, share knowledge and build a community of diverse voices. We want all ways of being and doing to feel welcome.

# How can I get involved? 

There are several ways to get involved with the Diversity Alliance: 

1. Participate in our monthly meetups:
- Learn new skills as we workshop open-source topics
- Help co-define the agenda and topics for future meetups
- Make new connections

2. Co-host a workshop: 
- Is there a topic you are enthusiastic about that you'd like to share with the community?
- Did you have a steep learning curve in a topic and you'd like to share your learnings? 

3. Are you organising sessions and you want to connect to a diverse group of people:
- The Diversity Alliance chairs would like to brainstorm how we can be more proactive about ensuring under-recognised people are better included.
