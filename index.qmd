# How can I get involved? 

There are several ways to get involved with the Diversity Alliance: 

1. Participating in our monthly meetups:
- learn new skills as we workshop open-source topics
- help co-define the agenda and topics for future meetups
- make new connections

2. Co-host a workshop: 
- is there a topic you are enthusiastic about that you'd like to share with the community 
- did you have a steep learning curve that you want to soften for others - let's share our tips and tricks.

3. Are you organising sessions and you want to tap into a diverse group of people:
- the PROUD chairs would like to brainstorm how we can be more proactive about ensuring under-recognised people are better included. 

- slack? 
- monthly meet ups / webinars
